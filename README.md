# Real-Time Anagram Generator with Dictionary API
A fun little Python project I built that plays with words and coding.

It takes any word you give it, finds all the possible anagrams, filters out the ones that aren’t real English words using the Dictionary API, and even lets you look up definitions interactively.

What It Does:

Shows how many theoretical anagrams your word could have
Lists all the valid English anagrams
Lets you pick an anagram and see its definition
It’s a small project, but a great way to explore Python, combinatorics, and APIs—all while having a bit of word-game fun.

How to Use It:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Install the required library:
pip install requests
Run the script:
python anagram_generator.py

Example:

Enter a word up to 8 characters: moon
There are 2 real anagrams of said word which are: mono, moon

Do you want to know what any of these words mean? (y/n): y
Definitions for 'mono':

(noun) mononucleosis, an infectious disease
